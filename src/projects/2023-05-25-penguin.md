**Penguins** are a group of [aquatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_bird "Water bird") [flightless birds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flightless_bird "Flightless bird") from the [order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology) "Order (biology)") **[Sphenisciformes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Sphenisciformes_by_population "List of Sphenisciformes by population")** ([/sfɪˈnɪsəfɔːrmiːz/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English")) of the [family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology) "Family (biology)") **Spheniscidae** ([/sfɪˈnɪsɪdiː, -daɪ/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English")).[\[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguin#cite_note-IOU-4) They live almost exclusively in the [Southern Hemisphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere "Southern Hemisphere"): only one [species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species "Species"), the [Galápagos penguin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gal%C3%A1pagos_penguin "Galápagos penguin"), is found north of the [Equator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator "Equator"). Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have [countershaded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countershading "Countershading") dark and white [plumage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumage "Plumage") and flippers for swimming. Most penguins feed on [krill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krill "Krill"), [fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish "Fish"), [squid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid "Squid") and other forms of [sea life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_life "Sea life") which they catch with their bills and swallow whole while swimming. A penguin has a spiny tongue and powerful jaws to grip slippery prey.[\[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguin#cite_note-5)

They spend roughly half of their lives on land and the other half in the sea. The largest living species is the [emperor penguin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_penguin "Emperor penguin") (*Aptenodytes forsteri*):[\[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguin#cite_note-6) on average, adults are about 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall and weigh 35 kg (77 lb). The smallest penguin species is the [little blue penguin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_penguin "Little penguin") (*Eudyptula minor*), also known as the fairy penguin, which stands around 30–33 cm (12–13 in) tall and weighs 1.2–1.3 kg (2.6–2.9 lb).[\[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguin#cite_note-pengsent-7) Today, larger penguins generally inhabit colder regions, and smaller penguins inhabit regions with temperate or [tropical climates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_climate "Tropical climate"). Some [prehistoric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehistoric "Prehistoric") penguin species were enormous: as tall or heavy as an adult human. There was a great diversity of species in [subantarctic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subantarctic "Subantarctic") regions, and [at least one giant species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palaeeudyptes_klekowskii "Palaeeudyptes klekowskii") in a region around 2,000 km south of the [equator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator "Equator") 35 [mya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mya_(unit) "Mya (unit)"), during the Late [Eocene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eocene "Eocene"), a climate decidedly warmer than today.[\[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguin#cite_note-8)
